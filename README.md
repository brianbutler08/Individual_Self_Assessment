# Individual Self Assessment

For this project I filled the circle role on our team. My primary responsibilites included:

## Database
- Conducting the initial exploration of the dataset, including creating the preliminary, sample dataset for testing (in jupyter notebook)
- Creating the entity relationship diagrams (with https://www.quickdatabasediagrams.com/)
- Performing the transformation of the raw dataset into our final patient database (jupyter and pgAdmin)
- Creating our six additional, categorical datasets

## APACHE Analysis
- Conducting a literature review on the use of APACHE in ICU environments
- Preparing the data and calculating APACHE II scores and predicted mortality rates for each patient (with assistance from https://github.com/kevinconroy/apacheII)

## Receiver Operator Characteristic (ROC) Curve Analysis
- Gathering information and resources on performing ROC analysis
- Running a logistic regression on APACHE II and APACHE IV variables
- Plotting ROC curves for our Balanced Random Forest Classifer, APACHE II and APACHE IV models

### Additionally, I contributed to other parts of the project as needed, including:
- Contributing charts, images and tables to the final data visualization dashboards
- Developing the outline for our presentation structure
- Contributing content to the Google slide deck
- Providing general advice and support to my teammates when needed

Our team worked extremely well together and we progressed through the last month of tasks seemlessly and cooperatively. We all settled comfortably into our primary roles and supported each other if anyone was having any issues. Collaborating with Emilie and Tyler was a lot of fun and I'm very proud of our final project.

## Greatest Personal Challenge

My greatest challenege with the course was maintaining the speed required to keep up from week to week. I generally tend to work slowly and deliberately in whatever I do to make sure that I fully understand the concepts before moving on, which I found at odds with the course, especially in the opening weeks. I needed to find a working pace that would allow me to move through the content while also providing me with the level of comprehension that I needed before moving on. For a few of the early modules, I moved through them too quickly and immediately went through them again after completing the challenge to ensure that I understood the content. For more complex modules, I spent well in excess of 30 hours per week going through the material slowly, leaving little time for the challenge.

However, by Week 6 or so I found a good rhythm and balance, allowing me to get the work done in a reasonable amount of time with a high level of comprehension. I'm looking forward to going back through he modules at my own pace to reinforce the skills and maybe pick up on some details that I may have missed before.
