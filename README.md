# Individual Self Assessment

For this project I filled the circle role on our team. My primary responsibilites included:

##Database
- Conducting the initial exploration of the dataset, including creating the preliminary, sample dataset for testing (in jupyter notebook)
- Creating the entity relationship diagrams (https://www.quickdatabasediagrams.com/)
- Performing the transformation of the raw dataset into our final patient database (jupyter and pgAdmin)
- Creating our six additional, categorical datasets

##APACHE Analysis
- Conducting a literature review on the use of APACHE in ICU environments
- Preparing the data and calculating APACHE II scores and predicted mortality rates for each patient (with great assistance from https://github.com/kevinconroy/apacheII)

##Receiver Operator Characteristic (ROC) Curve Analysis
- Gathering information and resources on performing ROC analysis
- Running a logistic regression on APACHE II and APACHE IV variables
- Plotting ROC curves for our Balanced Random Forest Classifer, APACHE II and APACHE IV models

Additionally, I contributed to other parts of the project as needed, including:
- Contributing charts, images and tables to the final data visualization dashboards
- Developed the outline for our presentation structure
- Contributing content to the Google slide deck

describes the role(s) they played over the course

in that role.
Presents a cohesive written summary of how they
contributed to each of the roles they did not take
on via team discussions, peer reviews, or other
means.
Additionally, the analysis should describe their
